      <h4 class="division-title">EARTH</h4>
      <p>Sunsets on Earth are commonly red or orange due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering.
         The majority of the Earth's atmosphere is made up of nitrogen and oxygen, 
         which scatter shorter wavelengths less effectively than longer wavelengths. 
         When the Sun is lower on the horizon at sunset, 
         light must travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere. 
         This scatters the shorter blue wavelength, allowing the longer red and orange wavelengths 
         to dominate the sky and give off the iconic warm colors of a sunset. We get to witness this 
         beautiful sight with our eyes daily and its just fascinating that the blue planet has a 
         red sunset and the red planet has a blue sunset. </p>

      <h4 class="division-title">MARS</h4>
      <p>As the sun sets on Mars, the sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach 
        our eyes. This means that more of the red light is scattered away, leaving behind the blue light.
         This is why sunsets on Mars appear blue. The amount of dust in the Martian atmosphere can vary
          depending on the time of year and the location on Mars. 
          When there is more dust in the atmosphere, the sunsets can appear more blue. 
          When there is less dust in the atmosphere, the sunsets can appear more muted in color. 
          Blue sunsets on Mars are a beautiful and unique sight. They are a reminder that even though 
          Mars is known as the Red Planet, it is a place of great diversity and wonder.</p>
